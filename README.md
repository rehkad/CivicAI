# CivicAI
CivicAI is a self-hosted AI chatbot that answers local government questions—like trash pickup, permits, or municipal codes—using public city data. Easily customizable for any U.S. city with local or cloud LLMs, vector search, and a simple web UI.

## Customizing for your city
The chatbot prompt lives in `prompts/system_prompt.txt`. Edit that file to reference your city's specific regulations, services, and website links. Restart the application after updating the prompt so the changes take effect.
